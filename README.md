## Overview

Hypothesis testing helps us determine whether observed differences in sample data are statistically significant.  
This repo shows how to conduct:

- **T‚Äëtests** for comparing means between two groups  
- **ANOVA** for comparing means across three or more groups

---

## Key Concepts

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: No difference between group means  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: A difference exists  
- **P‚Äëvalue**: Probability of observing your data if H‚ÇÄ were true  
- **Alpha (Œ±)**: Significance level (commonly 0.05)  
- **Statistically significant**: p-value < Œ±
